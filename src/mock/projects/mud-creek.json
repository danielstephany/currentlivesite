	"description": "I built the Mud Creek Coffee project to practice taking a non-responsive site and redesigning it into a modern web app. My goal with this project was to make a modular design so that i could have many of the same sections reusing the same bits of code therefor making this site more easily scaleable in the future. With This project I used Scss to organize and my css. The sliding nav that is used in mobile views is built with jQuery."
